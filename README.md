# DataStructure

### This repository is to help beginners understand data structure from scratch. Fundamental data structures are implemented in both Python (3.7) and C++ (11).


1. File menu:
    - **stack.py**: stack data strucure is implemented using Python3, support push, pop, and top operations.
    - **stack_array.cpp**: stack implemented using C++ using static array, support push, pop, and top operations.
    - **stack_list.cpp**: stack implemented using C++ using singly linked list, support push, pop, and top operations.
    - **queue.py** and **queue.cpp**: single ended queue implemented by Python3 and C++, support enqueue and dequeue operations.
    - **singly_linkedlist.py** and **singly_linkedlist.cpp**: singly linked list implemented using Python3 and C++, support insert, delete, and top operations.
    - **doubly_linkedlist.py** and **doubly_linkedlist.cpp**: doubly linked list implemented using Python3 and C++, support insert, delete, and top operations.
    - **BTree.py** and **BTree.cpp**: binary tree implemented using Python3 and C++, show tree traversal (including inorder, preorder, and postorder, all with iterative and recusrive implementation).

2. Data structure operations:
    - stack:
